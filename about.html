    <p>My name is Brad Buchholz and I live in Hillsboro, Oregon with my wife, daughter and two doodles. I went to college at Portland State University with a focus in communications and politcal science.</p>

    <p>I've always been facinated with food, and followed that passion into the restuarant industry where I worked as a cook at Toro Bravo for 4 years. I realized that while I loved food, the restuarant industry wasn't where I wanted to be. While I was figuring that out I got my Real Estate license and have been working as a broker helping people buy and sell houses.</p>

    <p>I finally decided to take a chance and follow my passion for computers and enrolled in coding school at Epicodus. I've been building computers since high school, and I'm excited to finally learn even more about the software side of computing!</p>
